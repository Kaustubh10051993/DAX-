DAX - Data Analysis Expression 
Use - To enhance the data modeling - mainly used to create Calculated column ,Calculated measure , Calculated Table 

DAX functions mainly devided into 3 types from application point of view 
1) SCALAR Function - returns the single value with either could be a row or aggregated value. Output of sclar function is column or single value
2) Tabular Function - These functions return Table as output 
3) Scalar or Tablular Function - Behaviour of the function changes with applicaiton

Difference between Caclulated column and Measure 
Calculated column - Uses RAM - memory , Changes the structure of table it is added to , Possible to create Calculated column in Selcted Table only hence 
the name of calculated column should be unique inside the Table selected, Row by Row operation is done and returns set of value. 
Measure - Uses CPU - Processors , Does not change Table structer, It can be applied to number of tables and hence the name should be unique for measure created.
This returns single value
